Overview
========

This is the quick-start guide to my PNGEncoder2 library, which compresses BitmapData objects into
PNG files (stored in ByteArray objects). For a more in-depth
explanation of how it works check out my [blog post][blog] about it.

Features
========

- **Blazing fast performance**: Written in [haXe][haxe] and highly
tuned for speed, it can outperform the [as3corelib PNGEncoder][encoder] by up
to 10x (on the FAST setting)! This is made possible by the **custom DEFLATE
library** I wrote from scratch specifically for this encoder.

- **Compression options**: Also made possible by my custom DEFLATE implementation,
you can now choose between compression levels: FAST, NORMAL, and GOOD (and
UNCOMPRESSED too, but...).

- **True asynchronous encoding**: Most other asynchronous PNG encoders
do the conversion from bitmap data to PNG data asynchronously, then
call ByteArray.compress() at the end -- which is a long, synchronous operation
that can take half the total encoding time or more. (An exception is the cool
[In-Spirit PNG encoder][in-spirit], but its asynchronous mode is amazingly slow,
and the SWC weighs in at over 100KB.) Mine does completely smooth encoding,
asynchronously (with progress events!) and scales to a target FPS without
wasting any cycles idling.

- **Large image support**: Can compress ridiculously large images on-the-fly,
since it does the work in manageable chunks (when done asynchronously) instead
of all at once. There is no single-step bottleneck.

- **Opaque bitmap support**: If your BitmapData is not transparent, then it will
be automatically encoded using the (generally smaller) 24-bit PNG format, otherwise the 32-bit
format is used.

- **Open source**: Use the haXe classes if you have a haXe project, or build
against an SWC if you have an AS3 project. See the licenses at the top of [PNGEncoder2.hx][PNGEncoder2.hx]
and [DeflateStream.hx][DeflateStream.hx] (both have separate, but similarly permissive, licenses).


Usage
=====

PNGEncoder2 supports both synchronous (fast but freezes the UI while it encodes)
and asynchronous PNG encoding (a smidgeon slower, but can maintain a target FPS).

### Synchronous example:

```as3
var bmp : BitmapData = ...;		// The bitmap you want to encode
var png : ByteArray;			// Variable to store the result

PNGEncoder2.level = CompressionLevel.FAST;	// Optional. Defaults to FAST

png = PNGEncoder2.encode(bmp);
```
	
### Asynchronous example:

```as3
var bmp : BitmapData = ...;		// The bitmap you want to encode

PNGEncoder2.level = CompressionLevel.FAST;	// Optional. Defaults to FAST

var encoder : PNGEncoder2 = PNGEncoder2.encodeAsync(bmp);
encoder.targetFPS = 12;		// Optional. Defaults to 20. Lower FPSs yield faster compression

// Because the encoder is guaranteed to fire the COMPLETE event
// after at least one frame, it's safe to attach the listener after
// starting the encoding (as long as it's done before the next frame)
encoder.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, function (e) {
	var png : ByteArray = encoder.png;
});

// encoder also dispatches ProgressEvent.PROGRESS events if you
// want to be notified of progress
```


Installation
============

### ActionScript 3

If you're using ActionScript 3 you can simply
[download the SWC][swc] file and link it to your
project. There are also ["slim" versions][slim] of the library
that contain only a single compression method each;
these are recommended for production since they are smaller (assuming you
only use one compression level).

To link an SWC into a project made with
the Flash CS5.5 IDE, the steps are as follows:

1. In the File menu, select "ActionScript Settings...".
2. Under the "Library Path" tab, click the little red
icon with the "f" logo on it. The tooltip of the button
reads: "Browse to SWC file"
3. Browse to wherever it was that you saved the SWC, and
select it
4. Press OK!

To link an SWC in other versions of the Flash IDE, follow
[this guide][how-to-swc] instead.


### HaXe

If you're using haXe, it's much simpler to use the source
directly than to fiddle with SWCs. All you need are the
[PNGEncoder2.hx][PNGEncoder2.hx] and [DeflateStream.hx][DeflateStream.hx] files available
at the [GitHub repository][repo].

If you want to have only one compression method compiled
(to cut down on generated code size), add `-D FAST_ONLY`,
`-D NORMAL_ONLY`, or `-D GOOD_ONLY` to your compile options
(this is equivalent to using the slim SWC versions).
